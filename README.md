### Starter Repository

### About This Series

Throughout this series, we'll introduce the Japa testing framework, which comes prepackaged with most AdonisJS starter kits. We'll understand how it integrates with AdonisJS, the CLI options it provides, it's assertion library, plugins, etc.

We'll start with introductary tests to get familiar with Japa and work our way up to testing full blown endpoints covering things like validation, file uploads, database operations, and more.
